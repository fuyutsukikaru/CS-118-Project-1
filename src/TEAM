Project 1 Part 2

Soomin Jeong
I set up handshakes and all responses (unchoke, interested, bitfield).
I also attempted uploading, but could not thread it properly.
The code for uploading is commented out.

Jeffrey Wang
I initialized the bitfield and calculated the size of the pieces.
I also attempted multi-threading, but failed miserably.

James Wu
I handled pieces and took care of all bit shifting operations.
I also dealt with sending and receiving payloads for all messages.
